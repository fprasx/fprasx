# Hello :)

I'm Felix, a sophomore student at MIT. I'm interested in most
things low-level or performance sensitive. Within these areas, I'm specifically
interested in developer tooling like compilers, because I like enjoy the feeling
of enabling fellow developers.

```
Ode to RustÔ∏è

while let, if let, where to go?
enums, patterns, control flow

dynamic dispatch, impl trait
lifetime bounds: tick-b, tick-a

trait bounds too - implied and derived
borrow check finished, my code survived!

borrowed, boxed, or placed in an Arc
rust lives for tick-static, inside my heart
