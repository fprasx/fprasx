# Hello :)

My name's Felix, and I'm an undergraduate student at MIT. I'm interested in most
things low-level or performance sensitive. Within these areas, I'm specifically
interested in developer tooling - abstraction and productivity often have a 
performance cost.

I'm interested in:
* developer tooling like languages, compilers, linters, debuggers
* software that developers use like databases, web frameworks
* useful libraries like fast implementations of data structures

Some example technologies I would love to work on:
* Turbopack
* Svelte
* Rust

I am an avid Rustacean!

Ode to RustÔ∏è

while let, if let, where to go?
enums, patterns, control flow

dynamic dispatch, impl trait
lifetime bounds: tick-b, tick-a

trait bounds too - implied and derived
borrow check finished, my code survived!

borrowed, boxed, or placed in an Arc
rust lives for tick-static, inside my heart
