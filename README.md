# Hello :)

I'm Felix, a junior MIT. I'm interested in most things low-level or
performance sensitive. Within those areas, I'm specifically interested in
developer tooling (compilers :o), because I think performance engineering is a
really nice way to improve DX and help others.

Feel free to reach out at _fpx at mit dot edu_!
